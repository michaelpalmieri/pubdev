 vSAN OSA Deployment Plan (2 x 10GbE NICs)
1. üìã Pre-requisites and Assumptions
Minimum of 3 ESXi hosts (preferably 4 for higher availability)

Each host has:

2 x 10GbE NICs

SSDs for cache tier

HDDs or SSDs for capacity tier

vSphere and vSAN licenses

vCenter Server deployed and available

Compatible hardware on VMware Compatibility Guide (VCG)

2. üîå Network Design
A. NIC Teaming Strategy
Use two 10GbE NICs with VMkernel NIC tagging and network separation via VLANs.

Purpose	VLAN ID	VMkernel Port	NIC Teaming (Active/Standby)
vSAN traffic	100	vmk1	vmnic0 Active / vmnic1 Standby
vMotion traffic	200	vmk2	vmnic1 Active / vmnic0 Standby

Optional: Add Management traffic and VM network using a separate NIC pair or VLAN tagging if appropriate.

B. vSwitch Design
Use vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS) for simplicity and uniform configuration

Enable Network I/O Control (NIOC) to prioritize vSAN traffic

Example vDS Configuration:
dvPortGroup-vSAN ‚Üí VLAN 100 ‚Üí vmk1

dvPortGroup-vMotion ‚Üí VLAN 200 ‚Üí vmk2

3. üíΩ Storage Design
A. vSAN Disk Group Layout (OSA)
Each host:

1 x Cache device (SSD)

1‚Äì7 x Capacity devices (HDD or SSD)

At least 1 disk group per host (can scale up to 5 per host)

B. Storage Policy Example
Failures to tolerate (FTT): 1 (RAID-1 or RAID-5)

RAID Level:

Use RAID-1 for better performance (write-heavy)

Use RAID-5 for capacity efficiency (requires ‚â•4 hosts)

4. üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps
Step 1: Prepare Hardware
Install ESXi (latest supported version)

Connect both 10GbE NICs

Verify BIOS/firmware for HBA, SSDs, NICs

Step 2: Configure Networking
Create vDS and port groups

Assign VMkernel ports (vmk1 for vSAN, vmk2 for vMotion)

Assign VLANs and set teaming policies

Step 3: Configure vSAN
Add ESXi hosts to vCenter

Enable vSAN on the cluster (Manual mode recommended)

Create disk groups on each host

Claim SSDs for cache, HDDs/SSDs for capacity

Step 4: Test Network and Disk
Use vSAN Health Check in vSphere

Run vmkping between vmk1 interfaces on each host

css
Copy
Edit
vmkping -I vmk1 <peer_ip> -s 1472 -d
Step 5: Deploy VMs and Apply Storage Policies
Apply policies like FTT=1, RAID-5 based on workload

Monitor performance and capacity

5. üîí Best Practices
Ensure multicast support for OSA (if older vSAN version)

Set MTU = 9000 (Jumbo Frames) on all switches and vmkernel ports

Monitor with vSAN Skyline Health, vROps, or vSAN Performance Service

Enable vSphere HA for VMs

Configure SNMP or email alerts for failures

6. üìà Optional: High Availability Enhancements
Add vSphere DRS to balance workloads

Implement vSphere Update Manager (VUM) for patching

Consider Stretch Cluster if geographic redundancy is required (requires witness host)

Here‚Äôs a detailed vSAN OSA deployment plan using three ESXi hosts, each with two 10GbE NICs. The plan outlines every step needed to design, configure, and deploy the vSAN cluster using Original Storage Architecture (OSA).

üì¶ vSAN OSA Deployment Plan (3 Hosts, 2x10GbE per Host)
üß± 1. Infrastructure Overview
Cluster Size: 3 ESXi Hosts

vSAN Architecture: Original Storage Architecture (OSA)

Network: Each host has 2 x 10GbE NICs

Disks per Host:

1 x SSD (for cache)

2‚Äì7 x HDDs (for capacity)

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Preparation and Prerequisites
Component	Description
Hardware	VMware HCL-compliant servers with two 10GbE NICs
Software	VMware vSphere (ESXi 7.0 or later), vCenter Server
Licensing	VMware vSAN license (Standard, Advanced, or Enterprise)
Disks	SSD for cache, HDD or SSD for capacity (min. 1 cache + 1 capacity disk per host)
Time sync	NTP configured on all hosts and vCenter
Firmware/Drivers	Updated firmware for SSDs, NICs, HBA; drivers as per HCL

üåê 3. Network Configuration (2 x 10GbE NICs)
A. Logical Design
Traffic Type	VMkernel	VLAN	Active/Standby NICs
Management	vmk0	VLAN 10	vmnic0 Active / vmnic1 Standby
vMotion	vmk1	VLAN 20	vmnic1 Active / vmnic0 Standby
vSAN	vmk2	VLAN 30	vmnic0 Active / vmnic1 Standby

B. vSwitch Design
Use vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS) (recommended) or vSwitch Standard (vSS).

Enable Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000) for performance.

Create separate port groups for vMotion and vSAN.

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Deployment Steps
üîπ Step 1: Install and Configure ESXi on Each Host
Install ESXi 7.0+ on all three hosts.

Configure Management Network (vmk0).

Set hostname, IP, NTP, DNS.

üîπ Step 2: Create vDS and Configure VMkernel Adapters
In vCenter, create a vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS).

Add both 10GbE NICs to the vDS uplinks.

Create 3 Port Groups:

PG-Management (VLAN 10)

PG-vMotion (VLAN 20)

PG-vSAN (VLAN 30)

Add VMkernel adapters:

vmk0: Management (attach to PG-Management)

vmk1: vMotion (attach to PG-vMotion)

vmk2: vSAN (attach to PG-vSAN)

Ensure each VMkernel has a static IP address.

üîπ Step 3: Configure NIC Teaming and MTU
On all port groups, configure:

Failover Order for vmk1 and vmk2 (see table above).

MTU 9000 on physical switches, vDS, and VMkernel ports.

Run jumbo frame test:

bash
Copy
Edit
vmkping -I vmk2 -d -s 8972 <peer vmk2 IP>
üîπ Step 4: Add Hosts to vCenter
Connect all three ESXi hosts to vCenter Server.

Place them in a new cluster called vSAN-Cluster.

üîπ Step 5: Enable vSAN on the Cluster
Right-click the cluster ‚Üí vSAN ‚Üí Enable.

Choose:

vSAN Original Storage Architecture (OSA)

Manual Disk Claiming

Confirm vmk2 is selected for vSAN traffic.

üîπ Step 6: Claim Disks and Create Disk Groups
On each host:

Create 1 or more Disk Groups:

1 x SSD (cache tier)

1‚Äì7 x HDDs (capacity tier)

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Disk Group 1:
  - Cache: 400 GB SSD
  - Capacity: 2 x 2 TB HDDs
üîπ Step 7: Validate and Test Cluster Health
Open vSAN > Monitor > Skyline Health.

Ensure:

All hosts are contributing storage.

Disk groups are healthy.

Network communication works (use vmkping if needed).

üì¶ 5. Storage Policy Configuration
Create VM Storage Policies to define availability and performance:

Policy Name	FTT	RAID Type	Min. Hosts	Use Case
FTT1-Mirror	1	RAID-1 (Mirroring)	3	High availability
FTT0	0	None	1	Non-critical VMs / testing

Apply appropriate policy when provisioning or migrating VMs.

üõ°Ô∏è 6. High Availability and vMotion
Enable vSphere HA for automatic VM failover.

Enable vMotion to allow live migration.

Test vMotion between hosts to confirm correct network configuration.

üìà 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
Enable vSAN Performance Service.

Monitor via:

vSAN Skyline Health

vCenter Alarms

Optional: vRealize Operations (vROps)

For maintenance:

Put host in vSAN Maintenance Mode ‚Üí ‚ÄúEnsure accessibility‚Äù (or "Full data migration" if removing a host).

Avoid simultaneous maintenance on multiple hosts.
